# Parallel Algorithms for Semisort and Related Problems
This repository contains the code for our paper "High-Performance and Flexible Parallel Algorithms for Semisort and Related Problems". It includes the implementations for semisort, histogram, and collect-reduce. This repository is built on [ParlayLib](https://github.com/cmuparlay/parlaylib), we plan to integrate our code into the main branch of it. A full reference documentation of ParlayLib can be found [here](https://cmuparlay.github.io/parlaylib/).  

Prerequisite
--------
+ g++ or clang with C++17 features support (Tested with g++ 12.1.1 and clang 14.0.6) on Linux machines.

Getting Code
--------
The code can be downloaded using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/ucrparlay/Parallel-Semisort.git
```

Compilation
--------
Compilation can be done by using the Makefile in the ``include/parlay/`` directory. The ``make`` command compiles the ``semisort``, `histogram`, and ``collect_reduce``.
```
cd include/parlay/
make
```
It uses clang by default. To compile with g++, pass the flag ``GCC=1``.
```
make GCC=1
```

To compile our code to run in sequential, use: 
```
make SERIAL=1 
```

Running Code
--------
Simply run
```
./semisort [n]
```
where ``n`` is the input size. The data generator can be configured in the file ``semisort.cpp``.
